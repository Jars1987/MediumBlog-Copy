# Medium Blog - NextJS Tailwind TypeScript Sanity Example

I decide to code along Sonnys turtorial to practice Typescript and to learn about Sanity.

### Here is the list of what I have gained with this project:

I now understand how to implement Sanity and how usefull a CMS can be. Since the back end and the DB is setup you only need to worry with the fron end.
With Sanity and Next it is quite quick to make a blog app or an ecommerce app.
The brillian part is to have an admin page already setup and customizable that allows you to access your db directly.

### This is what I have improved/changed in the project:

None so far.

### This is the future features for this project:

- Make the authentication feature.
- Implement the Like feature
